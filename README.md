# 🌍 Project Vision

Modern cities generate enormous amounts of data from:

- infrastructure systems
- transportation networks
- environmental sensors
- satellite imagery
- citizen feedback platforms

However, in many developing regions, including Egypt, these data sources remain **fragmented and underutilized**.

This project builds a **digital twin of a city district** that continuously:

- monitors urban conditions
- detects emerging issues
- predicts future risks
- supports decision-making

Instead of reacting **after problems occur**, city authorities can **anticipate risks, optimize resources, and improve urban resilience**.
